Overview:

Figuring out how to spend limited time in an unfamiliar city can be a challenge, and travel guides don't take you far from tourist destinations. Enter Trip Assistant, a web app to help you find things to do, see and eat in the city you are visiting based on your personal tastes. Trip Assistant combines the Yelp API with collaborative filtering to learn about what restaurants and activities you like, and it will get smarter the more you use it. It will then recommend you the name, rating, category, and link to the recommendations' Yelp page if you want to learn more. You can add trips, generate recommendations, and save them to your trip profile.
